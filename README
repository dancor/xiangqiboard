Xiangqiboard, a GUI for chinese chess 

Introduction:
I missed a graphicle gnome application to play Xiangqi . This one features a resizable board. It is still very simple, but it's playable right now.

Prerequisites:
Xiangqiboard.hs is tested on Ubuntu 7.10 GNU Linux and compiles with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.
You also need hoichess/hoixiangqi by Holger Ruckdeschel (http://www.hoicher.de/hoichess/).
hoichess Version 0.8.0 tested on Ubuntu 7.10 GNU Linux http://www.hoicher.de/hoichess/

Usage:
Use your mouse to enter the moves.

Acknowledgement:
Thanks to Holger Ruckdeschel for adapting HoiChess to Xiangqi, his HoiXiangqi motivated me further to to this GUI. Thanks to the cairo developers. The pieces are hand created with inkscape, a mighty fine free (GPL) software scalable vector graphics editor :-)
